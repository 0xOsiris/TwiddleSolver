# Puzzle Description
Twiddle is a simple puzzle game with an nxn grid of sequentially numbered tiles. This repository implements a Java BFS algorithm to solve an arbitrary 3x3 
twiddle board in the optimal number of moves. 

With a 3x3 board, the initial values in the 9 tiles are randomly initialized to a unique value in 1..9. A 3x3 board has 4 possible axis of rotation,
and a Clockwise/Counter Clockwise rotation on each of the 4 axis is a legal move. The goal is to order all the tiles in ascending order through a sequence 
of Clockwise/Counter Clockwise rotation on the 4 axis' of the board.

# Solver
Performs a BFS traversal of a tree generated by applying all possible moves to the initial state, and cutting out repeated states from the queue. Applying 
all possible moves to each sequential state until it reaches the goal state of the board. It then traverses back up the path to the initial state,
and outputs all of the moves leading to the goal state as the solution.

# Twiddle
Main function, this is will prompt you to enter an initial board state to be solved represented as a 9 digiit string.

# Node
Defines all of the logic on C/CC moves and their respective transformation logic on the board state.
